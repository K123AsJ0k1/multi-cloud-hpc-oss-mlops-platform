# Local Setup Tests

This test suite is designed to be run after a local deployment of the platform. For more information on local deployment, refer to the [setup.md](../setup.md) and/or the [local deployment guide](../tutorials/local_deployment).

> The tests won't work for other deployment methods (e.g. GCP).
